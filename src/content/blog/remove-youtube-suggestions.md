I have a love/hate relationship with Youtube. It's good and bad at the same time. But unlike Instagram and other stupid apps, I can't totally remove it from my life since it provides some value.

Removing the home, trending, shorts, video suggestions from Youtube makes it a great source of value without being a complete time sink. I can't count how many hours I've wasted in it by simply _feeling productive_.

I've been using Unhook extension along with a separate extension for blurring out the thumbnails to remove the fluff from Youtube. It worked great, but for some reason, Youtube videos embedded in other websites seem to break with Unhook extension(Both Firefox and Chromium). So I was searching for an alternative, first I tried to use Ublock filter for a similar functionality, but it wasn't a great experience. Then I stumbled across this new extension called [RYS](https://github.com/lawrencehook/remove-youtube-suggestions). It has way more options compared to Unhook and it's OPEN SOURCE(one extra brownie point!). It also had the option to blur out thumbnails, so now I don't need the other extension that I use for this functionality either. Its a win-win!
